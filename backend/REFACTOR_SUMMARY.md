# Refactoring Summary

## Before: Monolithic Structure
- Single `server.js` file (~350 lines)
- All routes, controllers, and utilities in one file
- Hard to maintain and scale

## After: MVC Structure

### 📁 Directory Structure
```
backend/
├── controllers/
│   └── productsController.js    # Business logic for products
├── routes/
│   └── products.js              # Route definitions
├── utils/
│   └── fileStorage.js          # File I/O utilities
├── seed/
│   └── sampleProducts.js       # Sample data
├── data/
│   └── products.json           # Product data storage
├── server.js                   # Minimal app setup (35 lines)
└── package.json
```

### 🔧 Key Changes

1. **server.js** (35 lines → was 359 lines)
   - Only Express app setup and middleware
   - Mounts routes from `routes/products.js`
   - Keeps health check endpoint
   - Updated console logs to show available routes

2. **routes/products.js**
   - Defines all product routes
   - Imports controller functions
   - Clean route definitions

3. **controllers/productsController.js**
   - Contains all business logic
   - Exports: `getProducts`, `createProduct`, `updateProduct`, `deleteProduct`, `seedProducts`
   - Handles sorting, filtering, pagination, CRUD operations

4. **utils/fileStorage.js**
   - File I/O utilities: `readProducts()`, `writeProducts()`, `generateId()`
   - Centralized file operations
   - Updated path to use `data/products.json`

5. **seed/sampleProducts.js**
   - Exported array of 10 sample products
   - Used by seed controller

6. **data/products.json**
   - Empty array for product storage
   - Separate from source code

### 🚀 Benefits

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each file has a single responsibility
- **Maintainability**: Easier to find and modify specific functionality
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new routes, controllers, or utilities
- **Testability**: Individual components can be tested in isolation
- **Code Reusability**: Utilities can be imported by multiple controllers

### 📋 API Endpoints (Unchanged)

- `GET /products` - Get products with filtering, sorting, pagination
- `POST /products` - Create new product
- `PUT /products/:id` - Update product
- `DELETE /products/:id` - Delete product
- `POST /products/seed` - Populate with sample data
- `GET /health` - Health check

### 🔄 Import/Export Pattern

All files use CommonJS (`require`/`module.exports`) as requested:
- Controllers import utilities and seed data
- Routes import controller functions
- Server imports and mounts routes
- Utilities are self-contained

The refactoring maintains all existing functionality while providing a clean, maintainable structure.
